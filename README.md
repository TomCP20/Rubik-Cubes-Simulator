# Rubik Cubes Simulator
## Description
This is a repository for my dissertation I created during my 3rd year of the Bachelor of Science with Honours Computing Science course at the University of East Anglia.
The project has the following features:
* Simulating a Rubik’s cube.
* A 3D interactive GUI to allow the user to interact with a Simulated cube.
* The ability to execute more than one solving algorithm, those being:
..* The Layer by Layer method.
..* The CFOP method.
* The ability to measure the efficiency of the algorithms using various metrics.
* The ability to show the effectiveness of the methods via a histogram.
* To show an animation of a cube being solved using the implemented methods with some information about the method being displayed alongside it.
* To allow the user to input a Rubik’s cube state into the software and see it be solved via the animation system.
• The ability to save and load multiple Rubik’s cube states.
## Running the project
The project was created in Unity editor version 2021.3.18f1 LTS and requires either that version or later to be run or built into an exe.
