# Rubik Cubes Simulator
## Description
This is a repository for my dissertation I created during my 3rd year of the BSc (Hons) Computing Science course at the University of East Anglia.
The project has the following features:
* Simulating a Rubik’s cube.
* A 3D interactive GUI to allow the user to interact with a Simulated cube.
* The ability to execute more than one solving algorithm, those being:
..* The Layer by Layer method.
..* The CFOP method.
* The ability to measure the efficiency of the algorithms using various metrics.
* The ability to show the effectiveness of the methods via a histogram.
* To show an animation of a cube being solved using the implemented methods with some information about the method being displayed alongside it.
* To allow the user to input a Rubik’s cube state into the software and see it be solved via the animation system.
* The ability to save and load multiple Rubik’s cube states.

## Running the project
To run the project first install Unity Editor version 2021.3.18f1 LTS then open the project.
Next, you can run the program in the editor or build it into an exe.
To run it in the editor hit the play button at the top of the editor.
To build the project go to File > Build Settings.
Here you can select that target platform however the program currently only has support for PC platforms.
Then select either build or build and run, the first builds the project and asks where you want to save it while the second does the same but automatically starts the project afterwards.
